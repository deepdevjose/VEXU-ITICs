# VEX-TIC-s

---

Just a repo with some VEX Robotics code ðŸ¤–
Yeah, you can totally use them, but youâ€™ll need to copy & paste the code since the files arenâ€™t in the right extension :)
I used to keep the src files updated, but now the compiled ones ended up with the .v5pyton extension (btw, the .v5pyton extension is just VEX being VEX, idk why)
